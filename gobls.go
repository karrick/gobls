// Scanner provides an interface for reading newline-delimited lines of text.
// It is similar to bufio.Scanner, but wraps the ReadLine method of bufio.Reader
// so lines of arbitrary length can be scanned.  Successive calls to the Scan
// method will step through the lines of a file, skipping the newline whitespace
// between lines.
//
// Scanning stops unrecoverably at EOF, or at the first I/O error.  Unlike
// bufio.Scanner, however, attempting to scan a line longer than
// bufio.MaxScanTokenSize will not result in an error, but will return the long
// line.
//
// Also like bufio.Scanner, it is not necessary to check for errors by calling
// the Err method until after scanning stops, when the Scan method returns
// false.
//
// This Scanner ought behave exactly like bufio.Scanner.  All methods ought to
// have the exact same return values while stepping through the given the
// provided io.Reader.
